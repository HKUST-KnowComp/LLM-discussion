The total cost of planting and maintaining the tree for x years is 90 + 3x. The total revenue from selling lemons in x years is 7 * 1.5 * x. To start earning money, the revenue should be greater than or equal to the cost, so we have the equation 7 * 1.5 * x >= 90 + 3x. Simplifying this equation, we get 10.5x >= 90 + 3x. By subtracting 3x from both sides, we have 7.5x >= 90. Dividing both sides by 7.5, we get x >= 12. Therefore, it will take at least 12 years before Carlos starts earning money on the lemon tree.\", \"answer\": \"12\"}"

Each year, Carlos earns $1.5 for each lemon and spends $3 on watering and feeding the tree. So, the total earnings after x years will be 7 * 1.5 * x = 10.5x. The total expenses after x years will be 3 * x = 3x. Carlos will start earning money when his total earnings exceed his total expenses. Therefore, the equation is 10.5x > 3x + 90.
