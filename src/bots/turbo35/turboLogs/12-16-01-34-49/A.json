Below is his response:\n{\"reasons\": \"Let's assign variables to the ages of the kids. Let J be the age of Jackson, A be the age of Amy, C be the age of Corey, and Jm be the age of James. We know that A = J + 5, A = C - 2, Jm = 10, and Jm = C - 1. From the equation Jm = C - 1, we can substitute Jm with 10 to get 10 = C - 1. Solving this equation, we find that C = 11. Substituting C = 11 into the equation A = C - 2, we get A = 11 - 2 = 9. Finally, substituting A = 9 into the equation A = J + 5, we can solve for J to find that J = 9 - 5 = 4. Therefore, Jackson is 4 years old.\", \"answer\": \"4\"}\n\nOne agent thinks the answer is 2. Below is his response:\n{\"reasons\": \"Let's assign variables to the ages of the kids.
