We also know that Corey is 2 years younger than Amy, so Corey's age is J + 5 - 2. James is 10 and is 1 year younger than Corey, so Corey's age is 10 + 1. Setting up the equation J + 5 - 2 = 10 + 1, we can solve for J. Simplifying the equation, we have J + 3 = 11. Subtracting 3 from both sides, we find that J = 8.
