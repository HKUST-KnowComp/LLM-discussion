Below are their responses:\nAfter critically reviewing the opinions provided, I agree with the reasoning and answer provided by my group members. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n{\"reasons\": \"Eliza's earnings for the first 40 hours = $400. Eliza's overtime earnings = $60. Therefore, her total earnings for the week = $400 + $60 = $460.\", \"answer\": \"460\"}\n\nAfter critically reviewing the opinions provided, I confirm that the correct answer is indeed 460.\nReasoning process:\n1. Eliza's regular earnings for the first 40 hours she worked is $10 per hour.\n2. Eliza's overtime earnings for the additional 5 hours she worked is $10 * 1.2 per hour.\n3. Eliza's total earnings for the week is the sum of her regular earnings and overtime earnings.\nAnswer:\n{\"reasons\": \"Regular earnings: 40 hours * $10/hour = $400. Overtime earnings: 5 hours * ($10/hour * 1.2) = $60. Total earnings: $400 + $60 = $460.\", \"answer\": \"460\"}"
