According to the problem, Lee used to run the 400-meter hurdles two seconds faster than Gerald, so Lee's time would be x - 2 seconds. Gerald improved his speed by 10%, which means his new time would be x - (10% of x) seconds. Given that Lee's time is 38 seconds, we can set up the equation x - (10% of x) = 38 and solve for x to find Gerald's new time. Solving the equation, we get x = 42, which means Gerald can now run the 400-meter hurdles in 42 seconds.\", \"answer\": \"42\"}"
