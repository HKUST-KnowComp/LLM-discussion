Since Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David, Sarah does 4D pounds of laundry. And since Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah, Raymond does (1/2) * 4D = 2D pounds of laundry. Given that Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry, we can substitute this value into the equation to find the amount of laundry David does. D = 400 / 4 = 100 pounds.
