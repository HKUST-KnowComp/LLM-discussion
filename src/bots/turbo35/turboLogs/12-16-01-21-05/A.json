The correct calculation for the second half of the year should be as follows:\n\nPremises:\n- Aleena is charged $140 per month for the streaming service.\n- The streaming company charges her the initial amount for the first half of the year.\n- The streaming company charges her 10% less money on the other half of the year.\n\nReasoning process:\n1. Calculate the total amount Aleena pays for the first half of the year:\n   - The first half of the year consists of 6 months.\n   - So, the total amount Aleena pays for the first half of the year is 6 * $140 = $840.\n2. Calculate the total amount Aleena pays for the second half of the year:\n   - The second half of the year also consists of 6 months.\n   - The streaming company charges her 10% less money for the second half of the year, which means she pays 90% of the original amount.\n   - So, the reduced monthly charge for the second half is $140 - ($140 * 0.10) = $140 - $14 = $126.\n   - Therefore, the total amount Aleena pays for the second half of the year is 6 * $126 = $756.\n3. Calculate the total amount Aleena pays for the entire year:\n   - The total amount Aleena pays for the entire year is the sum of the amounts she pays for the first and second halves of the year.\n   - So, the total amount Aleena pays for the entire year is $840 + $756 = $1596.\n\nAnswer:\n{\"reasons\": \"Aleena pays $840 for the first half of the year and $756 for the second half of the year, resulting in a total payment of $1596 for the entire year.\", \"answer\": \"1596\"}"
