The first glass costs $5.\n2. The second glass costs 60% of the price of the first glass, which is 0.6 * $5 = $3.\n3. The third glass costs $5, as it is the first glass in the next pair.\n4. The fourth glass costs 60% of the price of the third glass, which is 0.6 * $5 = $3.\n5. This pattern continues, with every odd-numbered glass costing $5 and every even-numbered glass costing $3.\n6. Since Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses, we can calculate the total cost by summing the costs of all the glasses.\n7. There are 8 pairs of glasses in 16 glasses, so the total cost of the odd-numbered glasses is 8 * $5 = $40.\n8. There are also 8 even-numbered glasses, so the total cost of the even-numbered glasses is 8 * $3 = $24.\n9.
