Do not copy other's entire answer, modify the part you believe is wrong.\n\nOther group members' opinions:\nThree agents think the answer is 80.\n\nYour group's opinions:\nTwo agents think the answer is 80. Below are their responses:\nLet's critically analyze the provided answers and update our response accordingly:\nPremises:\n- Friend 1's guess: 80\n- Friend 2's guess: 20 more than half of Friend 1's guess\n- Friend 3's guess: 25% more than Friend 1's guess\nReasoning process:\n1. Friend 2's guess is 20 more than half of Friend 1's guess:\n   Friend 2's guess = Friend 1's guess / 2 + 20\n2. Friend 3's guess is 25% more than Friend 1's guess:\n   Friend 3's guess = Friend 1's guess + (Friend 1's guess * 25 / 100)\n3. To find the average guess, we need to add up all the guesses and divide by the number of friends:\n   Average guess = (Friend 1's guess + Friend 2's guess + Friend 3's guess) / 3\nNow let's calculate the values step by step:\n1. Friend 2's guess:\n   Friend 2's guess = 80 / 2 + 20 = 40 + 20 = 60\n2. Friend 3's guess:\n   Friend 3's guess = 80 + (80 * 25 / 100) = 80 + 20 = 100\n3. Average guess:\n   Average guess = (80 + 60 + 100) / 3 = 240 / 3 = 80\nTherefore, the average guess of Gunter's friends is 80.\n{\"reasons\": \"Friend 2's guess = 80 / 2 + 20 = 40 + 20 = 60. Friend 3's guess = 80 + (80 * 25 / 100) = 80 + 20 = 100.
