Let's assume the number of bolts of blue fiber needed is x. According to the problem, the number of bolts of white fiber needed is half of x, which is x/2. Therefore, the total number of bolts needed is x + x/2. Combining like terms, we get 3x/2. However, we do not have a specific value for x in the problem statement, so we cannot determine the exact number of bolts needed. Therefore, the answer cannot be determined based on the given information. The answer provided by the other group members, 3 and 3/2, are incorrect as they do not consider the variable x.
