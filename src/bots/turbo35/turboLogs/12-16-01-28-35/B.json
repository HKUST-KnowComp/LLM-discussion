We know that Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David, so if Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry, David does 400 / 4 = 100 pounds of laundry. Now, we can find out how much laundry Raymond does. We are told that Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah, so Raymond does 400 / 2 = 200 pounds of laundry. Finally, we can calculate the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do by subtracting David's laundry from Raymond's laundry: 200 - 100 = 100.\", \"answer\": \"100\"}\n\nOne agent thinks the answer is 200 - D. Below is his response:\n{\"reasons\": \"Let's start by assigning variables to the unknowns. Let's say the amount of laundry David does is D, the amount Sarah does is S, and the amount Raymond does is R. We are given that Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry, so S = 400. We are also given that Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David, so S = 4D. Finally, we are given that Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah, so R = 0.5S. We need to find the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do, which is R - D. Substituting the values, we have R - D = (0.5S) - D = (0.5*400) - D = 200 - D.\", \"answer\": \"200 - D\"}\n(Hint: You must respond as required json format: \"{\"reasons\": \"(a string of your reasoning process)\", \"answer\": \"(a pure numeric value without unit)\"}\")"
