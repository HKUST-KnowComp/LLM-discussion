The top level of the sandcastle has a square footage of 16.\n2. According to the premise, each level has half the square footage of the level below it. So, the second level will have a square footage of 16/2 = 8.\n3. Applying the same logic, the third level will have a square footage of 8/2 = 4, and the fourth level will have a square footage of 4/2 = 2.\n4. To find the average square footage of a level, we need to sum up the square footages of all levels and divide by the total number of levels.\n   - Total square footage = 16 + 8 + 4 + 2 = 30\n   - Total number of levels = 4\n   - Average square footage = Total square footage / Total number of levels = 30 / 4 = 7.5\n\nBased on this reasoning process, the correct answer is 7.5.\n\n{\"reasons\": \"The average square footage of a level is calculated by summing up the square footages of all levels and dividing by the total number of levels.

Below is his response:\nBased on the reasoning process and calculations provided by both the other group members and our group member, it is clear that the correct answer is 7.5. \nThe reasoning process is as follows:\n1. The top level of the sandcastle has a square footage of 16.\n2. Each level has half the square footage as the level below it.\n3. Using this information, we can calculate the square footage of each level: \n   - Level 2: 16 / 2 = 8\n   - Level 3: 8 / 2 = 4\n   - Level 4: 4 / 2 = 2\n4.
