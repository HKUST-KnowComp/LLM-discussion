To find the new value of the house, we need to calculate 150% of the original value and add it to the original value. The profit is then calculated by subtracting the total cost from the new value.\n\nOriginal value of the house: $80,000\nIncrease in value due to repairs: $80,000 * 150% = $120,000\nNew value of the house: $80,000 + $120,000 = $200,000\n\nProfit = New value of the house - Total cost\nProfit = $200,000 - ($80,000 + $50,000)\nProfit = $200,000 - $130,000\nProfit = $70,000\n\nTherefore, Josh made a profit of $70,000.\n\n{\"reasons\": \"Josh bought the house for $80,000 and put in $50,000 in repairs, increasing the value of the house by 150%.
