I will provide you the detailed reasons and answers from your group member and answers from other group members. Use these opinions and your previous answer as additional advice, note that they maybe wrong. Do not copy other's entire answer, modify the part you believe is wrong.\n\nOther group members' opinions:\nThree agents think the answer is 595.\n\nYour group's opinions:\nTwo agents think the answer is 595. Below are their responses:\nAfter critically reviewing the provided answers, I can confirm that the correct answer is indeed 595. Both the reasoning process and calculations are accurate.\nReasoning process:\n1. Number of rubies = Number of diamonds - 35 (given)\n2. Number of emeralds = 2 * Number of rubies (given)\n3. Substitute the value of Number of rubies from step 1 into step 2: Number of emeralds = 2 * (Number of diamonds - 35)\n4. Substitute the value of Number of diamonds from the premises into step 3: Number of emeralds = 2 * (175 - 35)\n5. Simplify the expression in step 4: Number of emeralds = 2 * 140 = 280\n6. The total number of gems in the chest is the sum of diamonds, rubies, and emeralds: Total gems = Number of diamonds + Number of rubies + Number of emeralds\n7. Substitute the values of Number of diamonds, Number of rubies, and Number of emeralds from the premises into step 6: Total gems = 175 + (175 - 35) + 280\n8. Simplify the expression in step 7: Total gems = 175 + 140 + 280 = 595\nTherefore, the updated answer is:\n{\"reasons\": \"Number of rubies = Number of diamonds - 35; Number of emeralds = 2 * Number of rubies; Number of emeralds = 2 * (175 - 35); Number of emeralds = 2 * 140 = 280; Total gems = Number of diamonds + Number of rubies + Number of emeralds; Total gems = 175 + (175 - 35) + 280; Total gems = 175 + 140 + 280 = 595\", \"answer\": \"595\"}\n\nAfter critically reviewing the provided answers, I believe that the correct answer is indeed 595. The reasoning process and calculations provided in the previous response are accurate and align with the given premises. Therefore, my updated answer is as follows:\n{\"reasons\": \"Number of rubies = 175 - 35 = 140. Number of emeralds = 2 * 140 = 280.
