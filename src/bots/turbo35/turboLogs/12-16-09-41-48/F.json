Polly could throw the gold javelin, the only known weapon that could sleigh the dragon, for a distance of 400 feet, well within the reach of the dragon's flames.  But when Polly held the sapphire gemstone, she could throw the javelin three times farther than when not holding the gemstone. If holding the gemstone, how far outside of the reach of the dragon's flames could Polly stand and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin?\nNow please strictly answer this question in the json format: \"{\"reasons\": \"(a string of your reasoning process)\", \"answer\": \"(a pure numeric value without unit)\"}\""
