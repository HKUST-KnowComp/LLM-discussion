Below are their responses:\nBased on the opinions provided by both the other group members and your group members, it seems that the consensus is that the total cost is $694. Therefore, I will update my answer accordingly.\nReasoning process:\n1. Calculate the cost of the donuts: 3 dozen * $68 per dozen = $204.\n2. Calculate the cost of the mini cupcakes: 2 dozen * $80 per dozen = $160.\n3. Calculate the cost of the mini cheesecakes: 6 dozen * $55 per dozen = $330.\n4.
