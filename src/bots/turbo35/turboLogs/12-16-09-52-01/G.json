Polly could throw the gold javelin, the only known weapon that could sleigh the dragon, for a distance of 400 feet, well within the reach of the dragon's flames.  But when Polly held the sapphire gemstone, she could throw the javelin three times farther than when not holding the gemstone. If holding the gemstone, how far outside of the reach of the dragon's flames could Polly stand and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin?.\n\nHowever, now there is a draw:\nTwo agents think the answer is . Below is one of their responses:\n{\n  \"reasons\": \"Polly can throw the gold javelin for a distance of 400 feet without holding the gemstone. When holding the gemstone, she can throw the javelin three times farther. So, when holding the gemstone, she can throw the javelin for a distance of 400 * 3 = 1200 feet. However, the problem states that the dragon's flames have a reach of 1000 feet. Therefore, Polly cannot stand 1200 feet outside of the reach of the dragon's flames and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin. Instead, she can stand at a distance of 1000 - 400 = 600 feet outside of the reach of the dragon's flames and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin.\",\n  \"answer\": \"600\"\n}\n\nTwo agents think the answer is 600.

When she holds the gemstone, she can throw the javelin three times farther. Therefore, the distance she can throw the javelin while holding the gemstone is 400 * 3 = 1200 feet. However, the dragon's flames have a range of 1000 feet. This means that Polly needs to stand at a distance greater than 1000 feet to be outside of the reach of the dragon's flames.
