The company has a policy of increasing the salaries of each of its employees by 10% of the initial salary every year for those who've stayed in the company for five years. If Sylvie just clocked 5 years in the company last December, what's her annual salary after three more years of service?.\n\nHowever, now there is a draw:\nThree agents think the answer is 780. Below is one of their responses:\n{\"reasons\": \"Sylvie's initial salary is $600. After 5 years of service, her salary increases by 10% each year. After 3 more years, her salary will increase by 10% for each of those 3 years. Therefore, her annual salary after three more years of service will be $600 + ($600 * 0.1 * 3) = $600 + $180 = $780.\", \"answer\": \"780\"}\n\nThree agents think the answer is 726. Below is one of their responses:\n{\"reasons\": \"Sylvie's initial salary is $600. After 5 years of service, her salary will be increased by 10% of the initial salary every year.
