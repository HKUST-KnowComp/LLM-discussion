Here is the updated reasoning process:\n\nPremises:\n- Charlie can make 10 tapered candles from every pound of beeswax.\n- The cost of one pound of beeswax and wicks is $10.00.\n- Charlie sells each candle for $2.00.\n- Charlie wants to make and sell 20 candles.\n\nReasoning process:\n1. To make 20 candles, Charlie needs 20/10 = 2 pounds of beeswax.\n2. The cost of 2 pounds of beeswax and wicks is 2 * $10.00 = $20.00.\n3. Charlie sells each candle for $2.00, so the total revenue from selling 20 candles is 20 * $2.00 = $40.00.\n4. Charlie's net profit is the revenue minus the cost, which is $40.00 - $20.00 = $20.00.\n\nAnswer: \n{\"reasons\": \"To make 20 candles, Charlie needs 2 pounds of beeswax.
