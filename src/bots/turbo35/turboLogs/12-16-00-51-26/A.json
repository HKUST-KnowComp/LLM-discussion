John drives for 3 hours at a speed of 60 mph, so he covers a distance of 3 * 60 = 180 miles. (Premise 1)\n2. He spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic, so he doesn't cover any distance during that time. (Premise 3)\n3. He spends the next half-hour driving at a speed of 30 mph, so he covers a distance of 0.5 * 30 = 15 miles. (Premise 4)\n4. He drives the remaining time of the 4 hours at a speed of 80 mph. Since he already spent 2.5 hours (2 hours in standstill traffic + 0.5 hours at 30 mph), he has 4 - 2.5 = 1.5 hours left.\n   Therefore, he covers a distance of 1.5 * 80 = 120 miles. (Premise 5)\n5.
