John drives for 3 hours at a speed of 60 mph, covering a distance of 3 * 60 = 180 miles.\n2. John spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic, so he doesn't cover any distance during that time.\n3. John spends the next half-hour driving at a speed of 30 mph, covering a distance of 0.5 * 30 = 15 miles.\n4. John drives the remaining time of the 4 hours at a speed of 80 mph. Since he already spent 2.5 hours (2 hours in standstill traffic + 0.5 hours at 30 mph), he has 4 - 2.5 = 1.5 hours left to drive at 80 mph.\n5. John covers a distance of 1.5 * 80 = 120 miles during the remaining 1.5 hours.\n6.
