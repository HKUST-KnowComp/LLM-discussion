        "content": "After critically reviewing the provided answers and reasoning, I have found that the reasoning process and answer provided by your group members are correct. Therefore, I will provide the same answer as before.\n\nReasoning process:\n1. On Monday, Meredith wrote 5 articles.\n2. On Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 times more articles than on Monday. This means she wrote 2/5 * 5 = 2 articles more than on Monday. Therefore, she wrote a total of 5 + 2 = 7 articles on Tuesday.\n3. On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday. Since she wrote 7 articles on Tuesday, she wrote 2 * 7 = 14 articles on Wednesday.\nTo calculate the total number of hours she spent writing articles in the three days, we need to multiply the number of articles by the average time it takes to write an article.\n4. Total number of articles written in three days = 5 (Monday) + 7 (Tuesday) + 14 (Wednesday) = 26 articles.\n5. Total number of hours spent writing articles = 26 articles * 4 hours/article = 104 hours.\n\nAnswer: {\"reasons\": \"Meredith wrote 5 articles on Monday, 7 articles on Tuesday, and 14 articles on Wednesday. Therefore, she wrote a total of 26 articles. Since each article takes an average of 4 hours to write, the total number of hours she spent writing articles in the three days is 104 hours.\", \"answer\": \"104\"}"
