I will provide you the detailed reasons and answers from your group member and answers from other group members. Use these opinions and your previous answer as additional advice, note that they maybe wrong. Do not copy other's entire answer, modify the part you believe is wrong.\n\nOther group members' opinions:\nThree agents think the answer is 104.\n\nYour group's opinions:\nTwo agents think the answer is 104. Below are their responses:\nAfter considering the opinions and reasoning provided by both groups, I have determined that the correct answer is indeed 104 hours. The reasoning provided by both groups is consistent and accurate.\nReasoning process:\n1. On Monday, Meredith wrote 5 articles, which took a total of 5 * 4 = 20 hours.\n2. On Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 times more articles than on Monday. This means she wrote 2/5 * 5 = 2 articles more than on Monday.\n   So, the total number of articles she wrote on Tuesday is 5 + 2 = 7 articles.\n   The total time spent on writing these articles is 7 * 4 = 28 hours.\n3. On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday. Since she wrote 7 articles on Tuesday, she wrote 2 * 7 = 14 articles on Wednesday.\n   The total time spent on writing these articles is 14 * 4 = 56 hours.\n4. To calculate the total number of hours she spent writing articles in the three days, we add up the hours spent on each day:\n   Monday: 20 hours\n   Tuesday: 28 hours\n   Wednesday: 56 hours\n   Total hours = 20 + 28 + 56 = 104 hours\nAnswer: {\"reasons\": \"Meredith spent 20 hours on Monday, 28 hours on Tuesday, and 56 hours on Wednesday. The total number of hours she spent writing articles in the three days is 104.\", \"answer\": \"104\"}\n\nBased on the reasoning process provided by both my group members and the other group members, I can see that there is a consensus that the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles in the three days is 104 hours. Therefore, I will provide the same answer.\nReasoning process:\n1. On Monday, Meredith wrote 5 articles, which took a total of 5 * 4 = 20 hours.\n2. On Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 times more articles than on Monday. This means she wrote 2/5 * 5 = 2 articles more than on Monday.\n   Therefore, she wrote a total of 5 + 2 = 7 articles on Tuesday, which took a total of 7 * 4 = 28 hours.\n3. On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday. This means she wrote 2 * 7 = 14 articles on Wednesday, which took a total of 14 * 4 = 56 hours.\n4. To calculate the total number of hours she spent writing articles in the three days, we need to add up the hours for each day:\n   Monday: 20 hours\n   Tuesday: 28 hours\n   Wednesday: 56 hours\n   Total hours = 20 + 28 + 56 = 104 hours\nAnswer: {\"reasons\": \"Meredith spent 20 hours on Monday, 28 hours on Tuesday, and 56 hours on Wednesday.
