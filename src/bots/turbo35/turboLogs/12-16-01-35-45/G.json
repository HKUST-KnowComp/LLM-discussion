If there are two cats for every dog, and the number of dogs is 60, how many pets in total are in the neighborhood?.\n\nHowever, now there is a draw:\nThree agents think the answer is 168. Below is one of their responses:\n{\"reasons\": \"Let's denote the number of rabbits as R, the number of dogs as D, and the number of cats as C. We are given that R = (D + C) - 12. We are also given that C = 2D and D = 60. We can substitute these values into the equation for R to find the total number of pets in the neighborhood. R = (60 + 2D) - 12 = 60 + 2(60) - 12 = 60 + 120 - 12 = 168.
