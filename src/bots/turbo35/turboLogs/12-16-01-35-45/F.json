The number of cats is twice the number of dogs, so the number of cats is 2D.\n3. The number of rabbits is 12 less than the combined number of dogs and cats, so the number of rabbits is (D + 2D) - 12.\n4. We are given that the number of dogs is 60, so D = 60.\n5. Substituting D = 60 into the equations, we can find the number of cats and rabbits.\n   - The number of cats = 2 * 60 = 120\n   - The number of rabbits = (60 + 2 * 60) - 12 = 180\n6. Finally, we can calculate the total number of pets by adding the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits.\n   - Total number of pets = 60 + 120 + 180 = 360.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 360.\n\n{\"reasons\": \"Let's break down the problem step by step:\\n\\n1.
