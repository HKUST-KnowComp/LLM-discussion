If a 300g bag has 5 servings, how many grams can you eat if your daily calorie target is 2000 and you have already consumed 1800 calories?.\n\nHowever, now there is a draw:\nThree agents think the answer is 0. Below is one of their responses:\nAfter critically reviewing the opinions provided, I still believe that the correct answer is 120 grams. Here is my updated response:\nTo find out how many grams of chips can be eaten, we need to calculate the remaining calories that can be consumed. First, we need to find out how many calories have been consumed so far, which is 1800 calories. Then, we subtract the consumed calories from the daily calorie target of 2000 to get the remaining calories, which is 200 calories.\nNext, we divide the remaining calories by the calories per serving, which is 250 calories per serving, to find out how many servings can be eaten. 200 calories divided by 250 calories per serving equals 0.8 servings.\nHowever, since we cannot eat a fraction of a serving, we need to round down to the nearest whole number. Therefore, we can only eat 0 servings of chips.\nFinally, we multiply the number of servings (0) by the weight per serving, which is 300 grams divided by 5 servings, to get the total grams that can be eaten. 0 servings multiplied by 60 grams per serving equals 0 grams.\nTherefore, the answer is 0 grams.\n{\"reasons\": \"To find out how many grams of chips can be eaten, we need to calculate the remaining calories that can be consumed.
