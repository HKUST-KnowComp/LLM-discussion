He usually sells marigolds for $2.74 per pot, petunias for $1.87 per pot and begonias for $2.12 per pot. Artie has no change today, so he has decided to round all his prices to the nearest dollar.

Here is the updated response:\n\nPremises:\n- Price of marigolds per pot: $2.74\n- Price of petunias per pot: $1.87\n- Price of begonias per pot: $2.12\n- Number of marigold pots sold: 12\n- Number of petunia pots sold: 9\n- Number of begonia pots sold: 17\n\nReasoning process:\n1. Calculate the total revenue from marigolds: 12 pots * $2.74 per pot = $32.88\n2. Calculate the total revenue from petunias: 9 pots * $1.87 per pot = $16.83\n3. Calculate the total revenue from begonias: 17 pots * $2.12 per pot = $36.04\n4.
