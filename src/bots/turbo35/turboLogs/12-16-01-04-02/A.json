The ratio of Darrell's age to Allen's age is 7:11.\n2. The total age of Darrell and Allen now is 162.\n\nLet's assume the ages of Darrell and Allen are 7x and 11x, respectively, where x is a common factor.\n\nAccording to the second premise, the total age of Darrell and Allen now is 162. So, we can write the equation:\n7x + 11x = 162\n\nCombining like terms, we get:\n18x = 162\n\nDividing both sides of the equation by 18, we find:\nx = 9\n\nNow, we can calculate Allen's age. Allen's current age is 11x, which is 11 * 9 = 99.\n\nAdding 10 years to Allen's current age, we get:\n99 + 10 = 109\n\nTherefore, Allen's age 10 years from now is 109.\n\nUpdated Answer: {\"reasons\": \"Allen's current age is 99. Adding 10 years, Allen's age 10 years from now is 109.\", \"answer\": \"109\"}"
