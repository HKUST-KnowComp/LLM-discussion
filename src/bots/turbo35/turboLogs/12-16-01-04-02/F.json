Let's assume Darrell's age is 7x and Allen's age is 11x, where x is a common factor.\n2. The total age of Darrell and Allen now is 162.\n3. Setting up an equation: 7x + 11x = 162\n4. Simplifying the equation: 18x = 162\n5. Solving for x: x = 162 / 18 = 9\n6. Calculating Allen's current age: 11x = 11 * 9 = 99\n7. Adding 10 years to Allen's current age: 99 + 10 = 109\n\nTherefore, the updated answer is:\n\n{\"reasons\": \"Allen's current age is 99.

The ratio of Darrell's age to Allen's age is 7:11.\n2. The total age of Darrell and Allen now is 162.\nLet's assume the current ages of Darrell and Allen are 7x and 11x, respectively, where x is a common factor.\nAccording to the second premise, the total age of Darrell and Allen now is 162. So we can write the equation:\n7x + 11x = 162\nSimplifying the equation:\n18x = 162\nx = 162 / 18\nx = 9\nNow we can calculate Allen's age 10 years from now:\nAllen's current age = 11x = 11 * 9 = 99\nAllen's age 10 years from now = Allen's current age + 10 = 99 + 10 = 109\nAnswer: {\"reasons\": \"Allen's current age is 99.
