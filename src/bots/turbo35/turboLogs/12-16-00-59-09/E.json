Since the orange drink is two-thirds water, we can calculate it by multiplying 10 liters by 2/3. This gives us 6.67 liters of water in the orange drink.\nNext, we need to find the amount of water in the 15 liters of pineapple drink. Since the pineapple drink is three-fifths water, we can calculate it by multiplying 15 liters by 3/5. This gives us 9 liters of water in the pineapple drink.\nNow, let's subtract the spilled orange drink from the total amount of water. Since 1 liter of the orange drink was spilled, we subtract 1 liter from the total amount of water, which is 6.67 + 9 liters.

We know that three-fifths of the pineapple drink is water, so we can calculate 15 * (3/5) = 9 liters of water in the pineapple drink. Since we spilled 1 liter of the orange drink, we subtract that from the total amount of water in the orange drink, which gives us 6.67 - 1 = 5.67 liters of water remaining in the orange drink.
