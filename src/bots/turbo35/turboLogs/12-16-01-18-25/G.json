A delivery truck filled with identical boxes, each weighing 15 pounds, will pass over the bridge. The combined weight of the driver and the empty truck is 3755 pounds. What is the maximum number of boxes which can be loaded onto the truck while not exceeding the bridge's weight limit?.\n\nHowever, now there is a draw:\nThree agents think the answer is 163. Below is one of their responses:\n{\"reasons\": \"The weight limit of the bridge is 5000 pounds. The combined weight of the driver and the empty truck is 3755 pounds. Each box weighs 15 pounds. To find the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the weight limit, we need to subtract the weight of the driver and the empty truck from the weight limit of the bridge, and then divide the result by the weight of each box. This will give us the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck. Using this reasoning process, the correct answer is 163.\", \"answer\": \"163\"}\n\nThree agents think the answer is 83.
