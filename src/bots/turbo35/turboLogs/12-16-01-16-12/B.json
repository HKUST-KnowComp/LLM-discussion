Both the reasoning process and calculations are correct.\n\nReasoning process:\n1. Uriah removes 30 comic books, and each comic book weighs 1/4 pound. So, the weight of the comic books he removes is (30 * 1/4) = 7.5 pounds.\n2. Uriah needs to remove a total of 15 pounds from his book bag. He has already removed 7.5 pounds by removing the comic books. So, he still needs to remove (15 - 7.5) = 7.5 pounds.\n3. Each toy weighs 1/2 pound. To find the number of toys Uriah needs to remove, we divide the remaining weight he needs to remove by the weight of each toy: (7.5 / 1/2) = 15 toys.\n\nAnswer: {\"reasons\": \"Uriah removes 30 comic books, each weighing 1/4 pound, which is a total of 7.5 pounds.
