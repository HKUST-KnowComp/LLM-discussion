He removes 30 comic books, each weighing 1/4 pound. The weight of the comic books he removes is 7.5 pounds. He still needs to remove 7.5 pounds. Each toy weighs 1/2 pound. Therefore, he needs to remove 15 toys.\", \"answer\": \"15\"}\n\nAfter critically reviewing the provided answers and reasoning process, I can confirm that the correct answer is indeed 15 toys.\nReasoning process:\n1. Uriah removes 30 comic books, and each comic book weighs 1/4 pound. So, the weight of the comic books he removes is (30 * 1/4) = 7.5 pounds.\n2. Uriah needs to remove a total of 15 pounds from his book bag. He has already removed 7.5 pounds by removing the comic books. So, he still needs to remove (15 - 7.5) = 7.5 pounds.\n3. Each toy weighs 1/2 pound. To find the number of toys Uriah needs to remove, we divide the remaining weight he needs to remove (7.5 pounds) by the weight of each toy (1/2 pound). So, the number of toys he needs to remove is (7.5 / 1/2) = 15 toys.\nAnswer: {\"reasons\": \"Uriah needs to remove 15 pounds from his book bag. He removes 30 comic books, each weighing 1/4 pound. The weight of the comic books he removes is 7.5 pounds. He still needs to remove 7.5 pounds. Each toy weighs 1/2 pound. Therefore, he needs to remove 15 toys.\", \"answer\": \"15\"}"
