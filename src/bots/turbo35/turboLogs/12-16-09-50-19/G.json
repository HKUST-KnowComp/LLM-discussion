She gives the chickens their feed in three separate meals. In the morning, she gives her flock of chickens 15 cups of feed.  In the afternoon, she gives her chickens another 25 cups of feed.  How many cups of feed does she need to give her chickens in the final meal of the day if the size of Wendi's flock is 20 chickens?.\n\nHowever, now there is a draw:\nThree agents think the answer is . Below is one of their responses:\n{\n  \"reasons\": \"Wendi gives her chickens 15 cups of feed in the morning and 25 cups of feed in the afternoon. So, the total amount of feed given to the chickens in the first two meals is 15 + 25 = 40 cups. Since she gives each chicken 3 cups of feed in each meal, the total amount of feed given to the chickens in the first two meals is enough for 40 / 3 = 13.33 meals. Since Wendi gives her chickens 3 meals per day, she needs to give them an additional 3 - 13.33 = -10.33 meals worth of feed in the final meal of the day. However, since we cannot have a negative number of meals, we can round down to the nearest whole number. Therefore, Wendi needs to give her chickens -11 * 3 = -33 cups of feed in the final meal of the day. But since we cannot have a negative amount of feed, the answer is 0 cups.\",\n  \"answer\": \"0\"\n}\n\nThree agents think the answer is 20. Below is one of their responses:\n{\"reasons\": \"Wendi gives her chickens 15 cups of feed in the morning and 25 cups of feed in the afternoon. So far, she has given her chickens 15 + 25 = 40 cups of feed. Each chicken needs 3 cups of feed per day, so for 20 chickens, Wendi needs to give them a total of 20 * 3 = 60 cups of feed per day. Since she has already given them 40 cups of feed, she needs to give them an additional 60 - 40 = 20 cups of feed in the final meal of the day.\", \"answer\": \"20\"}"
