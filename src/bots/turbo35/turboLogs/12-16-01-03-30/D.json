The cost of the first pair of high heels is given as $33.\n2. The cost of the second pair of high heels is twice the cost of the first pair, so it is 2 * $33 = $66.\n3. The total cost of the two pairs of high heels is $33 + $66 = $99.\n4. The total cost of the boots is $5 more than the cost of the two pairs of high heels, so it is $99 + $5 = $104.\nAnswer:\n{\"reasons\": \"The cost of the boots is $104 because the total cost of the two pairs of high heels is $99 and the boots cost $5 more.\", \"answer\": \"104\"}"
