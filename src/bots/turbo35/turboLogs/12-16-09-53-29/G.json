If each class has 15 students and she charges $15.00 per student, how much money does she make in 1 week?.\n\nHowever, now there is a draw:\nThree agents think the answer is 7425. Below is one of their responses:\n{\"reasons\": \"Judy teaches 5 dance classes on weekdays, so she teaches a total of 5 * 5 = 25 classes on weekdays. She teaches 8 classes on Saturday. In total, she teaches 25 + 8 = 33 classes in a week. Each class has 15 students, so she teaches a total of 33 * 15 = 495 students in a week. She charges $15.00 per student, so she makes a total of 495 * 15 = $7425.00 in 1 week.\", \"answer\": \"7425\"}\n\nThree agents think the answer is 2925. Below is one of their responses:\n{\"reasons\": \"Judy teaches 5 dance classes on weekdays, each class has 15 students, so she teaches 5 * 15 = 75 students on weekdays. She charges $15.00 per student, so she makes 75 * 15 = $1125.00 on weekdays. Judy teaches 8 dance classes on Saturday, each class has 15 students, so she teaches 8 * 15 = 120 students on Saturday. She charges $15.00 per student, so she makes 120 * 15 = $1800.00 on Saturday. Therefore, Judy makes a total of $1125.00 + $1800.00 = $2925.00 in 1 week.\", \"answer\": \"2925\"}"

To calculate the total number of students she teaches in a week, we multiply the number of classes on weekdays (5) by the number of students per class (15), which gives us 5 * 15 = 75 students on weekdays. On Saturday, she teaches 8 classes with 15 students each, so she teaches 8 * 15 = 120 students on Saturday. Therefore, the total number of students she teaches in a week is 75 + 120 = 195 students. To calculate the total amount of money she makes in a week, we multiply the total number of students (195) by the price per student ($15.00), which gives us 195 * 15 = $2925.00. Therefore, the answer is 2925.\", \"answer\": \"2925\"}"
