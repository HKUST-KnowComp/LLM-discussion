Here is the updated reasoning process:\n\nPremises:\n- The cost of one chicken meal is $12.\n- Marie bought 5 packs of milk, and each pack costs $3.\n- Marie bought 4 apples, and each apple costs $1.50.\n- Marie paid a total of $50.\n- Each box of pizza costs $8.50.\n\nReasoning process:\n1. The cost of the chicken meal is $12.\n2. The cost of 5 packs of milk is 5 * $3 = $15.\n3. The cost of 4 apples is 4 * $1.50 = $6.\n4. The total cost of the chicken meal, milk, and apples is $12 + $15 + $6 = $33.\n5. Marie paid a total of $50, so the remaining amount is $50 - $33 = $17.\n6. Each box of pizza costs $8.50, so the number of boxes of pizza Marie ordered is $17 / $8.50 = 2.\n\nTherefore, Marie ordered 2 boxes of pizza.\n\nThe final answer in the json format is:\n{\"reasons\": \"The total cost of the chicken meal, milk, and apples is $33.
