Here's my updated reasoning:\n\nTo find out how much money Vincent saves, we need to compare the total cost of buying 18 flowers at the better price with the total cost of buying 18 flowers at the regular price. Let's calculate the total cost for each option and find the difference.\n\nBuying flowers in packages of 3 for $2.50 means that each flower costs $2.50 / 3 = $0.83.\n\nTherefore, buying 18 flowers at the better price would cost 18 * $0.83 = $14.94.\n\nBuying flowers in packages of 2 for $1 means that each flower costs $1 / 2 = $0.50.\n\nTherefore, buying 18 flowers at the regular price would cost 18 * $0.50 = $9.\n\nThe difference in cost is $14.94 - $9 = $5.94.\n\nTherefore, Vincent saves $5.94 by buying 18 flowers at the better price.\n\n{\"reasons\": \"To find out how much money Vincent saves, we need to compare the total cost of buying 18 flowers at the better price with the total cost of buying 18 flowers at the regular price.
