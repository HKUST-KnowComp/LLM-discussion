Since each can of tomatoes loses half its volume, the original volume of tomatoes used in the sauce would be double the final volume of the sauce.\\n2. Therefore, the original volume of tomatoes used would be 32 ounces * 2 = 64 ounces.\\n3. Since each 16 ounce can of tomatoes contains three tomatoes, we can calculate the number of cans used by dividing the original volume of tomatoes by the volume of each can: 64 ounces / 16 ounces = 4 cans.\\n4.
