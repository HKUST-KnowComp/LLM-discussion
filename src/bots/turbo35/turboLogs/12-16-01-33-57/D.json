Here is the updated reasoning process:\n\nPremises:\n- Adults eat 10 lbs of potato salad each.\n- Children eat half as much as adults.\n- There will be 20 adults and 5 children at the picnic.\n\nReasoning process:\n1. Calculate the total amount of potato salad needed for adults: 20 adults * 10 lbs/adult = 200 lbs.\n2. Calculate the total amount of potato salad needed for children: 5 children * (10 lbs/adult) / 2 = 25 lbs.\n3. Add the amounts of potato salad needed for adults and children: 200 lbs + 25 lbs = 225 lbs.\n\nTherefore, Ted needs to bring 225 pounds of potato salad to the picnic.\n\n{\"reasons\": \"Ted needs to calculate the total amount of potato salad needed for adults and children separately. First, calculate the amount of potato salad needed for adults by multiplying the number of adults by the amount an adult eats.
