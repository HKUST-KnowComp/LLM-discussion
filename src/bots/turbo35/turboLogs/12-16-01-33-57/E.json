First, we calculate the amount of potato salad needed for adults by multiplying the number of adults (20) by the amount one adult eats (10 lbs/adult), which gives us 200 lbs. Then, we calculate the amount of potato salad needed for children by multiplying the number of children (5) by half the amount one adult eats (10 lbs/adult) divided by 2, which gives us 25 lbs. Finally, we add the amounts of potato salad needed for adults and children together: 200 lbs + 25 lbs = 225 lbs.
