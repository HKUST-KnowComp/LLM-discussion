So the total cost of shorts is 3 * $16.50 = $49.50.\nMishka bought 3 pairs of pants, each costing $22.50. So the total cost of pants is 3 * $22.50 = $67.50.\nMishka bought 3 pairs of shoes, each costing $42. So the total cost of shoes is 3 * $42 = $126.\n\nTo find the total amount spent on all the clothing items, we need to add the costs of shorts, pants, and shoes together: $49.50 + $67.50 + $126 = $243.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n{\"reasons\": \"Mishka spent $49.50 on shorts, $67.50 on pants, and $126 on shoes. Adding these costs together, the total amount spent on all the clothing items is $243.\", \"answer\": \"243\"}"
