I will provide you the detailed reasons and answers from your group member and answers from other group members.

Do not copy other's entire answer, modify the part you believe is wrong.\n\nOther group members' opinions:\nThree agents think the answer is 294.\n\nYour group's opinions:\nTwo agents think the answer is 294. Below are their responses:\nAfter critically reviewing the provided answers, I can confirm that the correct answer is indeed 294.\nReasoning process:\n1. Calculate the number of dozens of eggs produced per day:\n   - Number of eggs produced per day: 252\n   - Number of eggs in a dozen: 12\n   - Number of dozens of eggs produced per day = Number of eggs produced per day / Number of eggs in a dozen = 252 / 12 = 21 dozens\n2. Calculate the total revenue from selling eggs per day:\n   - Price per dozen eggs: $2\n   - Number of dozens of eggs produced per day: 21\n   - Total revenue from selling eggs per day = Price per dozen eggs * Number of dozens of eggs produced per day = $2 * 21 = $42\n3. Calculate the total revenue from selling eggs per week:\n   - Total revenue from selling eggs per day: $42\n   - Number of days in a week: 7\n   - Total revenue from selling eggs per week = Total revenue from selling eggs per day * Number of days in a week = $42 * 7 = $294\nAnswer:\n{\"reasons\": \"Lloyd makes $42 per day and $294 per week by selling eggs.\", \"answer\": \"294\"}\n\nAfter critically reviewing the provided answers, I find that the reasoning process and final answer from both the other group members and your group members are correct.
