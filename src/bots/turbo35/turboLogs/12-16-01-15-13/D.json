Lloyd's chickens produce 252 eggs per day.\n2. Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, the number of dozens of eggs produced per day is 252 / 12 = 21 dozens per day.\n3. To find out how much money Lloyd makes per day, we multiply the number of dozens of eggs (21) by the price per dozen ($2), which gives us $42 per day.\n4. Since there are 7 days in a week, we can calculate the total amount of money Lloyd makes per week by multiplying the daily earnings ($42) by 7, which equals $294 per week.\n\nUpdated answer: {\"reasons\": \"Lloyd produces 21 dozens of eggs per day, which is equal to 147 dozens per week.
