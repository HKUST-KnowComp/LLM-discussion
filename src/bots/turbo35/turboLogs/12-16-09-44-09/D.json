Below is his response:\n{\"reasons\": \"Let's start by assigning variables to the unknowns: Let's say the amount of laundry David does is D, the amount of laundry Sarah does is S, and the amount of laundry Raymond does is R. We are given that Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry, so S = 400. We are also given that Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David, so S = 4D. Finally, we are given that Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah, so R = 0.5S. We can use these equations to find the values of D and R, and then calculate the difference between them. \nFrom the equation S = 400 and S = 4D, we can substitute S in the second equation with 400: 400 = 4D. Solving for D, we get D = 100.\nNow, let's find the value of R using the equation R = 0.5S. Substituting S with 400, we get R = 0.5 * 400 = 200.\nFinally, we can calculate the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do by subtracting D from R: 200 - 100 = 100.\nTherefore, the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do is 100 pounds.\", \"answer\": \"100\"}\n(Hint: You must respond as required json format: \"{\"reasons\": \"(a string of your reasoning process)\", \"answer\": \"(a pure numeric value without unit)\"}\")"
