Let R represent the amount of laundry Raymond does, S represent the amount of laundry Sarah does, and D represent the amount of laundry David does. We are given that Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry, so S = 400. We are also given that Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David, so S = 4D. Finally, we are given that Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah, so R = 0.5S. We can use these equations to solve for the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do. Substituting the value of S from the first equation into the second equation, we have 400 = 4D. Solving for D, we get D = 100. Substituting the value of S from the first equation into the third equation, we have R = 0.5 * 400 = 200. The difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do is R - D = 200 - 100 = 100 pounds of laundry.\", \"answer\": \"100\"}"
