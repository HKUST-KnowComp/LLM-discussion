We are given that Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry, so S = 400. We are also given that Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David, so S = 4D. Finally, we are given that Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah, so R = 0.5S. We can use these equations to find the values of D and R, and then calculate the difference between them. \n\nFrom the equation S = 400 and S = 4D, we can substitute S in the second equation with 400: 400 = 4D. Solving for D, we get D = 100.\n\nNow, let's find the value of R using the equation R = 0.5S. Substituting S with 400, we get R = 0.5 * 400 = 200.\n\nFinally, we can calculate the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do by subtracting D from R: 200 - 100 = 100.\n\nTherefore, the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do is 100 pounds.\", \"answer\": \"100\"}"
