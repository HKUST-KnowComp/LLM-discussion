Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David, so Sarah does 4*x pounds of laundry. Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah, so Raymond does (1/2)*(4*x) pounds of laundry. We are given that Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry, so we can substitute this value into the equation. Therefore, Sarah does 4*x = 400 pounds of laundry. Solving for x, we find that David does x = 400/4 = 100 pounds of laundry. Raymond does (1/2)*(4*x) = (1/2)*(4*100) = 200 pounds of laundry. The difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do is 200 - 100 = 100 pounds.\", \"answer\": \"100\"}"
