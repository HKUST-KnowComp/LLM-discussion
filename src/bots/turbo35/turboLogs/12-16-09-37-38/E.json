Then we'll subtract the spilled orange drink from the total amount of water in the two drinks. Finally, we'll calculate the proportion of water in the remaining 24 liters.\n\n1. Premise 1: 10 liters of orange drink is two-thirds water.\n2. Premise 2: 15 liters of pineapple drink is three-fifths water.\n3. Step 1: Calculate the amount of water in the remaining orange drink: 10 liters * (2/3) = 6.67 liters of water.\n4. Step 2: Calculate the amount of water in the pineapple drink: 15 liters * (3/5) = 9 liters of water.\n5. Step 3: Subtract the spilled orange drink (1 liter) from the total amount of water: 6.67 liters + 9 liters - 1 liter = 14.67 liters of water.\n6. Step 4: Calculate the proportion of water in the remaining 24 liters: (14.67 liters / 24 liters) * 100 = 61.125%.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 14.67.\n\n{\"reasons\": \"Let's calculate the amount of water in the remaining 10 liters of orange drink and the 15 liters of pineapple drink separately.
