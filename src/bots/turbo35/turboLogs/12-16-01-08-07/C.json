To find out how fast he runs, we need to calculate the average speed per hour. First, we calculate the total distance he runs in a week by multiplying 60 miles by 1 week, which gives us 60 miles. Then, we calculate the total time he runs in a week by adding the time he runs on each day. On the first day, he runs for 3 hours. On the other two days, he runs for half the time, which is 3/2 = 1.5 hours each day. So, the total time he runs in a week is 3 + 1.5 + 1.5 = 6 hours. Finally, we divide the total distance by the total time to find the average speed per hour. 60 miles / 6 hours = 10 miles per hour.\", \"answer\": \"10\"}"
