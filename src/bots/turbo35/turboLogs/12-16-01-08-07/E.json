To find out how fast he runs, we need to calculate the average speed per hour. First, we need to find out how many miles he runs on the other two days. Let's calculate: On the first day, he runs 3 hours * speed = 60 miles. So, his speed on the first day is 60 miles / 3 hours = 20 miles per hour. On the other two days, he runs half as much, so he runs 3 hours / 2 = 1.5 hours each day. Let's calculate the total distance he runs on the other two days: 1.5 hours * speed = x miles. The total distance he runs on the other two days is 2 * x miles. Adding up the distances, we have 60 miles = 20 miles per hour * 3 hours + 2 * x miles. Solving for x, we get x = (60 miles - 20 miles per hour * 3 hours) / 2 = 10 miles. Therefore, his speed on the other two days is 10 miles / 1.5 hours = 6.67 miles per hour. To find the average speed, we need to calculate the total distance divided by the total time. The total distance is 60 miles, and the total time is 3 hours + 1.5 hours + 1.5 hours = 6 hours. Therefore, his average speed is 60 miles / 6 hours = 10 miles per hour.\", \"answer\": \"10\"}"
