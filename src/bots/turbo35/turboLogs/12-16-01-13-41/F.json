The cost of blue ties is $40 each, so the total cost of blue ties is 40*x. The cost of red ties is 50% more than blue ties, so it is 1.5 times the cost of blue ties. The total cost of red ties is 1.5*40*2x. The total cost of ties is the sum of the cost of blue ties and the cost of red ties. So, the total cost of ties is 40*x + 1.5*40*2x. We are given that the total cost of blue ties is $200, so we can set up the equation 40*x = 200 and solve for x. Solving this equation gives us x = 5. Substituting this value back into the expression for the total cost of ties, we get 40*5 + 1.5*40*2*5 = 200 + 1.5*40*10 = 200 + 600 = 800. Therefore, John spent $800 on ties.\", \"answer\": \"800\"}"

The red ties cost 50% more than blue ties, so the cost of each red tie is 1.5 times the cost of each blue tie. John spent $200 on blue ties that cost $40 each, so the total cost of blue ties is 40x. The total cost of red ties is 1.5 times the cost of each blue tie multiplied by the number of red ties, which is 1.5 * 40 * 2x = 120x. Therefore, the total cost of ties is the sum of the cost of blue ties and the cost of red ties, which is 40x + 120x = 160x. We need to find the value of x to determine the total cost of ties. From the given information, we can set up the equation 40x = 200 and solve for x. Solving this equation gives us x = 5. Substituting this value back into the expression for the total cost of ties, we get 160 * 5 = 800. Therefore, John spent $800 on ties.\", \"answer\": \"800\"}"
