So, her running speed would be 3 * 2 = 6 miles per hour. We are also given that she can run at a rate of speed four times faster than she can walk. Therefore, her walking speed would be 6 / 4 = 1.5 miles per hour. Now, let's calculate the distances she can travel in six hours. She spends one-third of the time running, which is 6 * (1/3) = 2 hours. In 2 hours, she can run a distance of 6 * 2 = 12 miles. She spends two-thirds of the time walking, which is 6 * (2/3) = 4 hours. In 4 hours, she can walk a distance of 1.5 * 4 = 6 miles. Therefore, the total distance she can travel in six hours is 12 + 6 = 18 miles.\",\n  \"answer\": \"18\"\n}"
