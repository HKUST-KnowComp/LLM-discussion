Calculate the number of dozens of eggs produced per day:\n   - Number of dozens = Number of eggs / 12\n   - Number of dozens = 252 / 12\n   - Number of dozens = 21\n\n2. Calculate the number of dozens of eggs produced per week:\n   - Number of dozens per week = Number of dozens per day * 7\n   - Number of dozens per week = 21 * 7\n   - Number of dozens per week = 147\n\n3. Calculate the total amount of money Lloyd makes per week:\n   - Total money made per week = Number of dozens per week * Price per dozen\n   - Total money made per week = 147 * $2\n   - Total money made per week = $294\n\nAnswer: \n{\"reasons\": \"Lloyd produces 21 dozens of eggs per day, which is equivalent to 147 dozens per week.

Below are their responses:\nPremises:\n- Number of eggs produced per day: 252\n- Price per dozen eggs: $2\nReasoning process:\n1. To find out how many dozens of eggs Lloyd produces per day, we divide the total number of eggs produced (252) by 12 (since there are 12 eggs in a dozen).\n   - 252 / 12 = 21 dozens of eggs per day\n2.
