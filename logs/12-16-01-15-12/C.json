Calculate the number of dozens of eggs produced per day:\n   - Divide the total number of eggs produced per day (252) by 12.\n   - 252 / 12 = 21 dozens of eggs per day.\n\n2. Calculate the number of dozens of eggs produced per week:\n   - Multiply the number of dozens of eggs produced per day (21) by 7 (number of days in a week).\n   - 21 * 7 = 147 dozens of eggs per week.\n\n3. Calculate the total amount of money Lloyd makes per week:\n   - Multiply the number of dozens of eggs produced per week (147) by the selling price per dozen ($2).\n   - 147 * 2 = 294 dollars per week.\n\nAnswer:\n{\"reasons\": \"Lloyd produces 21 dozens of eggs per day, which is 147 dozens of eggs per week.
