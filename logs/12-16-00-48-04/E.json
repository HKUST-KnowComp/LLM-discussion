To find the new value of the house, we need to calculate 150% of the original value of the house and add it to the original value. Then, we can subtract the total cost (purchase price + repair cost) from the new value to find the profit. \nStep 1: Calculate 150% of $80,000: 150% * $80,000 = $120,000\nStep 2: Add the original value to the increase: $80,000 + $120,000 = $200,000\nStep 3: Subtract the total cost from the new value: $200,000 - ($80,000 + $50,000) = $70,000\nTherefore, Josh made a profit of $70,000.\", \"answer\": \"70000\"}\n\nOne agent thinks the answer is 115000.
