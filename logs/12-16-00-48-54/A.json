So far, she has given her chickens a total of 15 + 25 = 40 cups of feed. Wendi has 20 chickens in her flock. Therefore, each chicken has been given 40 / 20 = 2 cups of feed. Since Wendi feeds each chicken three cups of feed per day, she still needs to give each chicken an additional 3 - 2 = 1 cup of feed in the final meal of the day.
