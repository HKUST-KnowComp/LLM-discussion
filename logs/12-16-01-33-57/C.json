He knows that an adult dinosaur will eat 10 lbs of potato salad, and a child will eat half as much as an adult.  If there will be 20 adults and 5 children at the picnic, how many pounds of potato salad does Ted need to bring to the picnic if he hopes to have enough to feed everyone?\nNow please strictly answer this question in the json format: \"{\"reasons\": \"(a string of your reasoning process)\", \"answer\": \"(a pure numeric value without unit)\"}\"\n"

Below is his response:\n{\"reasons\": \"Ted needs to calculate the total amount of potato salad needed for adults and children separately. \n1. The amount of potato salad needed for adults is 10 lbs per adult.\n2. The amount of potato salad needed for children is half of what adults eat, which is 10/2 = 5 lbs per child.\n3. There will be 20 adults and 5 children at the picnic.\n4. Therefore, the total amount of potato salad needed for adults is 20 * 10 = 200 lbs.\n5. And the total amount of potato salad needed for children is 5 * 5 = 25 lbs.\n6. To find the total amount of potato salad needed for everyone, we add the amounts needed for adults and children: 200 + 25 = 225 lbs.\n\", \"answer\": \"225\"}\n\nOne agent thinks the answer is 125. Below is his response:\n{\"reasons\": \"Ted needs to calculate the total amount of potato salad needed for both adults and children. First, he needs to find out how much potato salad one child will eat by dividing the amount an adult eats by 2. Then, he needs to multiply the amount one child eats by the number of children attending the picnic. Next, he needs to multiply the amount an adult eats by the number of adults attending the picnic. Finally, he needs to add the two amounts together to get the total amount of potato salad needed.\", \"answer\": \"125\"}"
