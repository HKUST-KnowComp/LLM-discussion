The discounted price is 25% less than the original price, so the discounted price is (100% - 25%) of the original price. This can be calculated as x * (100% - 25%) = 19.50. Simplifying the equation, we have x * 75% = 19.50. Dividing both sides of the equation by 75%, we get x = 19.50 / 75%. Converting 75% to decimal form, we have x = 19.50 / 0.75.
