So, if Lee's time is 38 seconds, Gerald's original time would be 38 + 2 = 40 seconds. Now, Gerald improved his speed by 10%. To find his new time, we need to subtract 10% of his original time from his original time. 10% of 40 is 4, so his new time would be 40 - 4 = 36 seconds. Therefore, Gerald, with his improved diet, can run the 400-meter hurdles in 36 seconds.\", \"answer\": \"36\"}"
