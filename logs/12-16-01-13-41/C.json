John spent $200 on blue ties that cost $40 each, so the number of blue ties x is 200/40 = 5. The number of red ties is 2x = 2*5 = 10. The cost of each red tie is 1.5 times the cost of each blue tie, so the cost of each red tie is 1.5*40 = 60. Therefore, John spent 10*60 = 600 dollars on red ties.

Let's assume that John buys x blue ties.\n2. According to the first premise, John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, so he buys 2x red ties.\n3. According to the second premise, the red ties cost 50% more than blue ties. Since the blue ties cost $40 each, the red ties cost $40 + 50% of $40 = $40 + $20 = $60 each.\n4. John spent $200 on blue ties, so the total cost of the blue ties is $200.\n5. Since each blue tie costs $40, the number of blue ties bought (x) can be calculated as $200 / $40 = 5.\n6. According to the first premise, John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, so the number of red ties bought is 2 * 5 = 10.\n7. The total cost of the red ties can be calculated as 10 * $60 = $600.\n8. The total cost of the ties is the sum of the cost of the blue ties and the cost of the red ties, which is $200 + $600 = $800.\nAnswer: {\"reasons\": \"John spent $200 on blue ties and $600 on red ties, so the total cost of the ties is $200 + $600 = $800.\", \"answer\": \"800\"}\n\n{\"reasons\": \"Let's start by assigning variables to the unknown quantities. Let x represent the number of blue ties John bought. Since he bought twice as many red ties as blue ties, the number of red ties he bought is 2x.

The red ties cost 50% more than blue ties, so the cost of red ties is 1.5 times the cost of blue ties, which is 1.5 * 40x = 60x. John spent $200 on blue ties, so we can set up the equation 40x = 200 to solve for x. Solving for x, we find that x = 5. Therefore, John bought 5 blue ties and 2 * 5 = 10 red ties. The total cost of blue ties is 40 * 5 = $200, and the total cost of red ties is 60 * 10 = $600. Adding these two costs together, John spent $200 + $600 = $800 on ties.\", \"answer\": \"800\"}"
