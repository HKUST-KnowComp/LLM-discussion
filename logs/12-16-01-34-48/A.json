We know that A = J + 5, A = C - 2, Jm = 10, and Jm = C - 1. From the equation Jm = C - 1, we can substitute Jm with 10 to get 10 = C - 1. Solving this equation, we find that C = 11. Substituting C = 11 into the equation A = C - 2, we get A = 11 - 2 = 9. Finally, substituting A = 9 into the equation A = J + 5, we can solve for J to find that J = 9 - 5 = 4.
