Let's assume Melanie started with \"x\" vacuum cleaners.\n2. She sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, which is (1/3) * x.\n3. After selling at the green house, she has (x - (1/3)x) vacuum cleaners left.\n4. She sold 2 more vacuum cleaners to the red house, which leaves her with (x - (1/3)x - 2) vacuum cleaners.\n5. She then sold half of what was left at the orange house, which is (1/2) * (x - (1/3)x - 2).\n6. After selling at the orange house, Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left, so we can set up the equation: (1/2) * (x - (1/3)x - 2) = 5.\n7. Simplifying the equation: (x - (1/3)x - 2) = 10.\n8. Combining like terms: (2/3)x - 2 = 10.\n9. Adding 2 to both sides of the equation: (2/3)x = 12.\n10. Multiplying both sides by 3/2 to isolate x: x = (12 * 3/2).\n11. Simplifying: x = 18.\n\nBased on this reasoning process, the answer is 18.\n{\"reasons\": \"Melanie started with 18 vacuum cleaners.\", \"answer\": 18}"
