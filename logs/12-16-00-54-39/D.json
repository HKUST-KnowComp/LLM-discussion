Below is his response:\nBased on the reasoning process provided by both the other group members, it seems that there is a mistake in the calculation done by the agent who suggested the answer of 6. Let's go through the correct reasoning process again:\nPremises:\n- Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house.\n- She sold 2 more vacuum cleaners to the red house.\n- She sold half of what was left at the orange house.\n- Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left.\nReasoning process:\n1.

According to the problem, Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left, so we can set up the equation: (1/2)(x - (1/3)x - 2) = 5.\n9. Simplifying the equation: (1/2)(3x - x/3 - 6) = 5.\n10.
