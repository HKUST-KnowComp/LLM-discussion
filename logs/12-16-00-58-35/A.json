Below are their responses:\n{\"reasons\": \"Let's calculate the total time Marissa has spent on the trail so far. She took 1 hour to walk the first 4 miles and another hour to walk the next 2 miles. So, she has spent a total of 1 + 1 = 2 hours on the trail. Now, let's calculate the total distance she has walked so far. She walked 4 miles in the first hour and 2 miles in the second hour, so the total distance she has walked so far is 4 + 2 = 6 miles. Now, let's calculate the remaining distance she needs to walk. The total distance of the trail is 12 miles, and she has already walked 6 miles, so the remaining distance is 12 - 6 = 6 miles. Finally, let's calculate the speed she needs to walk the remaining distance. She wants her average speed to be 4 miles per hour, and she has 2 hours to walk the remaining 6 miles.

We know that the total distance is 12 miles and the total time is 1 hour + 1 hour + x hours. We also know that the average speed is 4 miles per hour.
