Calculate the total cost of supplies for 20 candles:\n   - The cost of 1 pound of beeswax and wicks is $10.00.\n   - Since Charlie wants to make 20 candles, the total cost of supplies is 20 * $10.00 = $200.00.\n\n2. Calculate the total revenue from selling 20 candles:\n   - Each candle is sold for $2.00.\n   - Since Charlie wants to sell 20 candles, the total revenue is 20 * $2.00 = $40.00.\n\n3. Calculate the net profit:\n   - Net profit is calculated by subtracting the total cost of supplies from the total revenue.\n   - Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost of supplies = $40.00 - $200.00 = -$160.00.\n\nAnswer: \n{\"reasons\": \"The total cost of supplies for 20 candles is $200.00. The total revenue from selling 20 candles is $40.00. Therefore, the net profit is -$160.00.\", \"answer\": \"-160\"}"
