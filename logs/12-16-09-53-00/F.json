The owner's manual for her car says that her tank holds 12 gallons of gas. To find out how many miles Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we need to calculate the miles per gallon (MPG) of her car. MPG can be calculated by dividing the total miles driven by the total gallons of gas used. So, we can calculate the MPG as 100 miles / 4 gallons = 25 miles per gallon. Now, to find out how many miles Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we need to multiply the MPG by the total gallons her tank can hold. So, the answer is 25 miles per gallon * 12 gallons = 300 miles.\", \"answer\": \"300\"}"
