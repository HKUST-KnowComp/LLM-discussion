Let's say the amount of laundry David does is 'D', the amount Sarah does is 'S', and the amount Raymond does is 'R'. We are given that Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry, so S = 400. We are also given that Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David, so S = 4D. Finally, we are given that Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah, so R = 0.5S. We can substitute the value of S in terms of D into the equation for R to find the amount of laundry Raymond does in terms of D.
