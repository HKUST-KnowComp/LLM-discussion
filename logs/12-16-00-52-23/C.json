Eliza's regular earnings for the first 40 hours she worked this week can be calculated by multiplying her rate per hour ($10) by the number of hours worked (40):\n   Regular earnings = $10/hour * 40 hours = $400\n\n2. Eliza's overtime earnings for the additional 5 hours she worked can be calculated by multiplying her regular hourly rate ($10) by the overtime pay rate (1.2) and then multiplying it by the number of overtime hours (5):\n   Overtime earnings = $10/hour * 1.2 * 5 hours = $60\n\n3. Eliza's total earnings for the week can be calculated by adding her regular earnings and overtime earnings:\n   Total earnings = Regular earnings + Overtime earnings = $400 + $60 = $460\n\nAnswer: \n{\"reasons\": \"Eliza's regular earnings for the first 40 hours are $400. Her overtime earnings for the additional 5 hours are $60. Therefore, her total earnings for the week are $460.\", \"answer\": \"460\"}"
