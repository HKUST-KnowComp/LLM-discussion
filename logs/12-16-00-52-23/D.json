Calculate Eliza's earnings for the first 40 hours:\n   - Eliza's rate per hour for the first 40 hours is $10.\n   - Eliza worked for 40 hours.\n   - Therefore, her earnings for the first 40 hours = $10/hour * 40 hours = $400.\n\n2. Calculate Eliza's earnings for the overtime hours:\n   - Eliza's regular hourly rate is $10.\n   - Eliza receives an overtime pay of 1.2 times her regular hourly rate.\n   - Eliza worked for 45 hours in total, so she worked 5 overtime hours (45 - 40).\n   - Therefore, her overtime earnings = $10/hour * 1.2 * 5 hours = $60.\n\n3. Calculate Eliza's total earnings for the week:\n   - Eliza's earnings for the first 40 hours = $400.\n   - Eliza's overtime earnings = $60.\n   - Therefore, her total earnings for the week = $400 + $60 = $460.\n\nAnswer: {\"reasons\": \"Eliza's earnings for the first 40 hours = $400. Eliza's overtime earnings = $60. Therefore, her total earnings for the week = $400 + $60 = $460.\", \"answer\": \"460\"}"
