Below is his response:\n{\n  \"reasons\": \"Let's first find out how fast Dana can run and walk. We know that she can skip at a rate of 3 miles per hour, which is half as fast as she can run. So, her running speed is 3 * 2 = 6 miles per hour. Since she can run at a rate of speed four times faster than she can walk, her walking speed is 6 / 4 = 1.5 miles per hour. Now, let's calculate how far she can travel in six hours. If she spends one-third of the time running, she will run for 6 * (1/3) = 2 hours. In 2 hours, she can travel 6 * 2 = 12 miles. If she spends two-thirds of the time walking, she will walk for 6 * (2/3) = 4 hours. In 4 hours, she can travel 1.5 * 4 = 6 miles. Therefore, in total, she can travel 12 + 6 = 18 miles in six hours.\",\n  \"answer\": \"18\"\n}"
