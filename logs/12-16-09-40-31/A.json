Dana can skip at a rate of speed that is half as fast as she can run, which means her running speed is 2 * 3 = 6 miles per hour.\\n\\n2. Dana spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking. If she spends 6 hours in total, she spends 6 * 1/3 = 2 hours running and 6 * 2/3 = 4 hours walking.\\n\\n3. Dana can travel 6 miles per hour while running, so in 2 hours, she can travel 6 * 2 = 12 miles.\\n\\n4. Dana can travel 3 miles per hour while walking, so in 4 hours, she can travel 3 * 4 = 12 miles.\\n\\n5. Therefore, in total, Dana can travel 12 + 12 = 24 miles in 6 hours.\", \"answer\": \"24\"}"
