He knows that an adult dinosaur will eat 10 lbs of potato salad, and a child will eat half as much as an adult.  If there will be 20 adults and 5 children at the picnic, how many pounds of potato salad does Ted need to bring to the picnic if he hopes to have enough to feed everyone?\nNow please strictly answer this question in the json format: \"{\"reasons\": \"(a string of your reasoning process)\", \"answer\": \"(a pure numeric value without unit)\"}\"\n"

Below is his response:\n{\"reasons\": \"Ted needs to calculate the total amount of potato salad needed for both adults and children. First, he needs to find the amount of potato salad needed for adults by multiplying the number of adults (20) by the amount of potato salad an adult eats (10 lbs). This gives us 20 adults * 10 lbs/adult = 200 lbs of potato salad. Next, he needs to find the amount of potato salad needed for children by multiplying the number of children (5) by half the amount an adult eats (5 lbs). This gives us 5 children * 5 lbs/child = 25 lbs of potato salad. Finally, Ted needs to add the amount of potato salad needed for adults and children to find the total amount needed.
