Below is his response:\n{\"reasons\": \"Let's start by finding Dana's running speed. We know that she can skip at a rate of 3 miles per hour, which is half as fast as she can run. So her running speed is 3 * 2 = 6 miles per hour. Now, let's find her walking speed. We are given that Dana can run at a rate of speed four times faster than she can walk. So her walking speed is 6 / 4 = 1.5 miles per hour. Now, let's calculate the distances traveled during running and walking. Dana spends one-third of the time running, which is 6 * (1/3) = 2 hours. In 2 hours, she can travel a distance of 6 * 2 = 12 miles. Dana spends two-thirds of the time walking, which is 6 * (2/3) = 4 hours. In 4 hours, she can travel a distance of 1.5 * 4 = 6 miles. Finally, let's calculate the total distance traveled. The total distance traveled is 12 + 6 = 18 miles.\", \"answer\": \"18\"}"
