On Monday, Meredith wrote 5 articles, which took a total of 5 * 4 = 20 hours.\n\n2. On Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 times more articles than on Monday. This means she wrote 2/5 * 5 = 2 articles more than on Monday.\n   So, the total number of articles she wrote on Tuesday is 5 + 2 = 7 articles.\n   The total time spent on writing these articles is 7 * 4 = 28 hours.\n\n3. On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday. Since she wrote 7 articles on Tuesday, she wrote 2 * 7 = 14 articles on Wednesday.\n   The total time spent on writing these articles is 14 * 4 = 56 hours.\n\n4. To calculate the total number of hours she spent writing articles in the three days, we add up the hours spent on each day:\n   Monday: 20 hours\n   Tuesday: 28 hours\n   Wednesday: 56 hours\n\n   Total hours = 20 + 28 + 56 = 104 hours\n\nAnswer: {\"reasons\": \"Meredith spent 20 hours on Monday, 28 hours on Tuesday, and 56 hours on Wednesday.
