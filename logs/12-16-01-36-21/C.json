Next, we need to find the number of girls in the grade. Since the total number of students is 200, and there are 80 boys, the number of girls is 200 - 80 = 120. Now, we need to find the number of girls in the girl scout. 2/3 of the girls are in the girl scout, so there are (2/3) * 120 = 80 girls in the girl scout. Finally, we can find the number of girls not in the girl scout by subtracting the number of girls in the girl scout from the total number of girls.
