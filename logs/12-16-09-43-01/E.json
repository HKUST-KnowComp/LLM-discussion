Below are their responses:\nPremises:\n- Number of diamonds = 175\n- Number of rubies = Number of diamonds - 35\n- Number of emeralds = 2 * Number of rubies\nReasoning process:\nLet's start by using the given information to find the number of rubies and emeralds.\nGiven that the number of diamonds is 175, we can label this as:\n(a) Number of diamonds = 175\nWe are also told that there are 35 fewer rubies than diamonds. So, the number of rubies can be expressed as:\n(b) Number of rubies = Number of diamonds - 35\nSince the number of emeralds is twice the number of rubies, we can write:\n(c) Number of emeralds = 2 * Number of rubies\nNow, let's substitute the values from (a) and (b) into (c) to find the number of emeralds.\nSubstituting (a) into (b):\nNumber of rubies = 175 - 35\nNumber of rubies = 140\nSubstituting (b) into (c):\nNumber of emeralds = 2 * 140\nNumber of emeralds = 280\nFinally, to find the total number of gems in the chest, we add the number of diamonds, rubies, and emeralds:\nTotal number of gems = Number of diamonds + Number of rubies + Number of emeralds\nTotal number of gems = 175 + 140 + 280\nTotal number of gems = 595\nAnswer: {\"reasons\": \"Number of diamonds = 175, Number of rubies = 140, Number of emeralds = 280, Total number of gems = 595\", \"answer\": \"595\"}\n\nLet's break down the problem step by step:\nPremises:\n- Number of diamonds: 175\n- Number of rubies: 35 fewer than diamonds\n- Number of emeralds: twice the number of rubies\nReasoning process:\n1.
