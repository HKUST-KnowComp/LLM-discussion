Below are their responses:\nPremises:\n- Mishka bought 3 pairs of shorts at $16.50 each.\n- Mishka bought 3 pairs of pants at $22.50 each.\n- Mishka bought 3 pairs of shoes at $42 each.\nReasoning:\nTo find out how much Mishka spent on all the clothing items, we need to calculate the total cost of the shorts, pants, and shoes separately, and then add them together.\n1. Cost of the shorts:\n   Mishka bought 3 pairs of shorts at $16.50 each.\n   So, the total cost of the shorts = 3 * $16.50 = $49.50.\n2. Cost of the pants:\n   Mishka bought 3 pairs of pants at $22.50 each.\n   So, the total cost of the pants = 3 * $22.50 = $67.50.\n3. Cost of the shoes:\n   Mishka bought 3 pairs of shoes at $42 each.\n   So, the total cost of the shoes = 3 * $42 = $126.\n4. Total cost of all the clothing items:\n   To find the total cost, we need to add the cost of the shorts, pants, and shoes.\n   Total cost = Cost of the shorts + Cost of the pants + Cost of the shoes\n              = $49.50 + $67.50 + $126\n              = $243.\nAnswer: \n{\"reasons\": \"Mishka spent $49.50 on shorts, $67.50 on pants, and $126 on shoes.
