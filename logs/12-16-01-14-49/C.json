So the total number of units in the building is 15 * 8 = 120. Next, we need to find the number of occupied units. The problem states that 3/4 of the building is occupied. So the number of occupied units is 3/4 * 120 = 90. Finally, to find the number of unoccupied units, we subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units. Therefore, the total number of unoccupied units in the building is 120 - 90 = 30.\", \"answer\": \"30\"}"
