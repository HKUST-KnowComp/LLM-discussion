He knows that an adult dinosaur will eat 10 lbs of potato salad, and a child will eat half as much as an adult.  If there will be 20 adults and 5 children at the picnic, how many pounds of potato salad does Ted need to bring to the picnic if he hopes to have enough to feed everyone?\nNow please strictly answer this question in the json format: \"{\"reasons\": \"(a string of your reasoning process)\", \"answer\": \"(a pure numeric value without unit)\"}\"\n"
