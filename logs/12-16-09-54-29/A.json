He knows that an adult dinosaur will eat 10 lbs of potato salad, and a child will eat half as much as an adult.  If there will be 20 adults and 5 children at the picnic, how many pounds of potato salad does Ted need to bring to the picnic if he hopes to have enough to feed everyone?\nNow please strictly answer this question in the json format: \"{\"reasons\": \"(a string of your reasoning process)\", \"answer\": \"(a pure numeric value without unit)\"}\"\n"

There will be 20 adults at the picnic, and each adult will eat 10 lbs of potato salad. So the total amount of potato salad needed for adults is 20 adults * 10 lbs/adult = 200 lbs.\\n\\nNow let's calculate the amount of potato salad needed for children. There will be 5 children at the picnic, and each child will eat half as much as an adult. So each child will eat 10 lbs/2 = 5 lbs of potato salad. The total amount of potato salad needed for children is 5 children * 5 lbs/child = 25 lbs.\\n\\nTo find the total amount of potato salad needed for everyone, we add the amount needed for adults and children: 200 lbs + 25 lbs = 225 lbs.\\n\\nTherefore, Ted needs to bring 225 pounds of potato salad to the picnic.\", \"answer\": \"225\"}"
