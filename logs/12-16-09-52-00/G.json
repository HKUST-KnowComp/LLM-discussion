So, when holding the gemstone, she can throw the javelin for a distance of 400 * 3 = 1200 feet. However, the problem states that the dragon's flames have a reach of 1000 feet. Therefore, Polly cannot stand 1200 feet outside of the reach of the dragon's flames and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin. Instead, she can stand at a distance of 1000 - 400 = 600 feet outside of the reach of the dragon's flames and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin.\", \"answer\": \"600\"}"
