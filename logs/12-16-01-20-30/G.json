Starting after 20 years, she becomes entitled to 5% of the value of the pension per year. If she quits after 30 years, we need to calculate the annual pension she will receive. After 30 years, Marcy will receive 5% of the value of the pension per year. 5% of $50,000 is $2,500. So, her annual pension after 30 years will be $50,000 + $2,500 = $52,500.\", \"answer\": \"52500\"}"
