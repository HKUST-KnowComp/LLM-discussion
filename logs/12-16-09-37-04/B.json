This gives us a total salary of $35,000 as a teacher. Next, we calculate her salary as a cheerleading coach by multiplying her hourly rate of $30 by the number of hours she works per week (15) and the number of weeks she works in a year (50). This gives us a total salary of $22,500 as a coach. Finally, we add her salaries as a teacher and a coach to find her annual salary.
