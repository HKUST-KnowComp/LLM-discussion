Calculate the initial amount for the first half of the year:\n   - Number of months in the first half of the year = 12 / 2 = 6 months\n   - Initial amount = $140 * 6 months = $840\n\n2. Calculate the amount for the remaining half of the year:\n   - Number of months in the remaining half of the year = 12 - 6 = 6 months\n   - 10% less amount = $140 - ($140 * 10%) = $140 - ($140 * 0.10) = $140 - $14 = $126\n   - Amount for the remaining half of the year = $126 * 6 months = $756\n\n3.

Calculate the total amount charged for the first half of the year:\n   - The first half of the year consists of 6 months.\n   - The monthly charge is $140.\n   - So, the total amount charged for the first half of the year is 6 * $140 = $840.\n2. Calculate the total amount charged for the second half of the year:\n   - The second half of the year also consists of 6 months.\n   - The monthly charge is 10% less than $140, which is (10/100) * $140 = $14 less.\n   - So, the monthly charge for the second half of the year is $140 - $14 = $126.\n   - Therefore, the total amount charged for the second half of the year is 6 * $126 = $756.\n3. Calculate the total amount charged for the whole year:\n   - The total amount charged for the first half of the year is $840.\n   - The total amount charged for the second half of the year is $756.\n   - So, the total amount charged for the whole year is $840 + $756 = $1596.\nAnswer: {\"reasons\": \"The total amount charged for the first half of the year is $840.
