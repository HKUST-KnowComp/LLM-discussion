The cost of 3 dozen donuts is calculated by multiplying the cost per dozen ($68) by the number of dozens (3): 3 * $68 = $204.\n2. The cost of 2 dozen mini cupcakes is calculated by multiplying the cost per dozen ($80) by the number of dozens (2): 2 * $80 = $160.\n3. The cost of 6 dozen mini cheesecakes is calculated by multiplying the cost per dozen ($55) by the number of dozens (6): 6 * $55 = $330.\n4. To find the total cost, we add the costs of the donuts, cupcakes, and cheesecakes: $204 + $160 + $330 = $694.\n\nAnswer: \n{\"reasons\": \"The cost of 3 dozen donuts is $204.
