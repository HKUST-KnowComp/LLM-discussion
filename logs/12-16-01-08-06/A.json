To find out how fast he runs, we need to calculate the average speed per hour. First, we calculate the total distance he runs in a week by multiplying 60 miles by 1 week, which gives us 60 miles. Then, we calculate the total time he runs in a week by adding the time he runs on each day. On the first day, he runs for 3 hours. On the other two days, he runs for half the time, which is 3/2 = 1.5 hours each day. So, the total time he runs in a week is 3 + 1.5 + 1.5 = 6 hours. Finally, we divide the total distance by the total time to find the average speed per hour. 60 miles / 6 hours = 10 miles per hour.\", \"answer\": \"10\"}"

Below is his response:\n{\"reasons\": \"John runs 60 miles a week. He runs 3 days a week. He runs 3 hours the first day and half as much the other two days he runs.\\n\\nFirst, we need to find out how many miles John runs each day. Since he runs 60 miles a week and runs 3 days a week, we can divide 60 by 3 to find that he runs 20 miles each day.\\n\\nNext, we need to find out how long John runs on the other two days. We know that he runs 3 hours on the first day, so he runs half as much on the other two days. Therefore, he runs 3 / 2 = 1.5 hours on the other two days.\\n\\nFinally, we can calculate how fast John runs by dividing the distance he runs by the time he runs. Since he runs 20 miles each day and runs for 3 hours on the first day and 1.5 hours on the other two days, we can calculate his speed as 20 / (3 + 1.5 + 1.5) = 20 / 6 = 3.33 miles per hour.\", \"answer\": \"3.33\"}\n\nOne agent thinks the answer is 6.67. Below is his response:\n{\"reasons\": \"John runs a total of 60 miles in a week, so he runs an average of 60/3 = 20 miles per day. On the first day, he runs for 3 hours, and on the other two days, he runs half as much. So, on the first day, he runs at a speed of 20/3 = 6.67 miles per hour. On the other two days, he runs for 3/2 = 1.5 hours each day. Therefore, his speed on the other two days is 20/(1.5*2) = 6.67 miles per hour. Thus, John runs at a speed of 6.67 miles per hour.\", \"answer\": \"6.67\"}"
