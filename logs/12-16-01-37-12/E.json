The original volume of the tomatoes used in the sauce is 32 ounces * 2 = 64 ounces.\\n3. Since each 16 ounce can of tomatoes contains three tomatoes, we can calculate the number of cans used by dividing the original volume of the tomatoes by 16 ounces per can.\\n4. The number of cans used is 64 ounces / 16 ounces per can = 4 cans.\\n5.
