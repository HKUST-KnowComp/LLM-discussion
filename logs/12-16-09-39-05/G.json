We are given that the cost of one pair of heels is $33 and the cost of the other pair is twice as much, which is $33 * 2 = $66. The total cost of the two pairs of heels is $33 + $66 = $99. According to the problem, the cost of the boots is $5 less than the total cost of the two pairs of heels. Therefore, the cost of the boots can be calculated as $99 - $5 = $94. Hence, the answer is 94.\", \"answer\": \"94\"}"
