        "content": "{\"reasons\": \"Based on the given information, Judy teaches 5 dance classes on weekdays and 8 classes on Saturday. Each class has 15 students and she charges $15.00 per student. To calculate the total number of students she teaches in a week, we multiply the number of classes on weekdays (5) by the number of students per class (15), which gives us 5 * 15 = 75 students on weekdays. On Saturday, she teaches 8 classes with 15 students each, so she teaches 8 * 15 = 120 students on Saturday. Therefore, the total number of students she teaches in a week is 75 + 120 = 195 students. To calculate the total amount of money she makes in a week, we multiply the total number of students (195) by the price per student ($15.00), which gives us 195 * 15 = $2925.00. Therefore, the answer is 2925.\", \"answer\": \"2925\"}"
