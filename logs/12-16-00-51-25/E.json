He tries to get home in 4 hours but spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic.  He spends the next half-hour driving at a speed of 30mph, before being able to drive the remaining time of the 4 hours going at 80 mph.

John spends the next half-hour driving at a speed of 30 mph.\n4. John drives the remaining time of the 4 hours at a speed of 80 mph.\n\nTo find out how far John is from home at the end of the 4 hours, we need to calculate the total distance traveled.\n\nReasoning process:\n1. John drives for 3 hours at a speed of 60 mph, so the distance covered in those 3 hours is 3 hours * 60 mph = 180 miles. (Premise 1)\n2. John spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic, so he doesn't cover any distance during that time. (Premise 2)\n3. John spends the next half-hour driving at a speed of 30 mph, so the distance covered in that half-hour is 0.5 hours * 30 mph = 15 miles. (Premise 3)\n4. John drives the remaining time of the 4 hours at a speed of 80 mph, so the distance covered in that time is 1.5 hours * 80 mph = 120 miles. (Premise 4)\n\nTherefore, the total distance traveled by John is 180 miles + 15 miles + 120 miles = 315 miles.\n\nAnswer: {\"reasons\": \"John drives for 3 hours at a speed of 60 mph, covering 180 miles.

John drives at a speed of 80 mph for the remaining time of the 4-hour trip, which is 4 hours - 2 hours - 0.5 hours = 1.5 hours. So the distance covered in that time is 80 mph * 1.5 hours = 120 miles.
