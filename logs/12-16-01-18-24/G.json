The weight limit of the bridge is 5000 pounds. The combined weight of the driver and the empty truck is 3755 pounds. Each box weighs 15 pounds. Subtracting the weight of the driver and the empty truck from the weight limit of the bridge gives us 5000 - 3755 = 1245 pounds. Dividing 1245 by the weight of each box, which is 15 pounds, gives us the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck: 1245 / 15 = 83.\", \"answer\": \"83\"}"
