Sophia needed to put in 4 gallons of gas to fill up her tank. Sophia's tank holds 12 gallons of gas. To find out how many miles Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we need to calculate the miles per gallon (MPG) of her car. MPG is calculated by dividing the total miles driven by the total gallons of gas used. First, we calculate the MPG: MPG = 100 miles / 4 gallons = 25 miles per gallon. Then, we can calculate the distance Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas by multiplying the MPG by the number of gallons her tank holds: Distance = 25 miles per gallon * 12 gallons = 300 miles.\",\n  \"answer\": \"300\"\n}"
