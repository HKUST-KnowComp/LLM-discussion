To find out how many miles she can drive on a single tank of gas, we need to calculate the miles per gallon (MPG) of her car. MPG is calculated by dividing the total miles driven by the total gallons of gas used. First, we calculate the MPG: MPG = Total miles driven / Total gallons of gas used. Then, we can calculate the miles Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas by multiplying the MPG by the number of gallons her tank holds: Miles on a single tank of gas = MPG * Number of gallons her tank holds.\",\n  \"answer\": \"300\"\n}"
