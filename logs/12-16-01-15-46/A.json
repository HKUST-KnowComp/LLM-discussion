Therefore, the time taken to travel back at a rate of 6 mph is the same as the time taken to travel forward at a rate of 10 mph. The total time taken for the round trip is 3 hours.

He sails from 1 to 4 PM, which is a total of 3 hours. The distance traveled during this time is 10 miles per hour multiplied by 3 hours, which equals 30 miles. Tom then travels back at a rate of 6 mph. To find the time it takes him to get back, we need to divide the distance traveled by the speed. The distance traveled is 30 miles, and the speed is 6 mph.
