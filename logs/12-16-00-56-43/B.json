Calculate the increase in value for the jewelry: 2.5% of $5,000 = $125\n2. Calculate the increase in value for the electronic gadgets: 1.2% of $8,000 = $96\n3. Calculate the final value of the jewelry: $5,000 + $125 = $5,125\n4. Calculate the final value of the electronic gadgets: $8,000 + $96 = $8,096\n5. Calculate the profit for the jewelry: $5,125 - $5,000 = $125\n6. Calculate the profit for the electronic gadgets: $8,096 - $8,000 = $96\n7.
