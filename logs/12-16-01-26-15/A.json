He usually sells marigolds for $2.74 per pot, petunias for $1.87 per pot and begonias for $2.12 per pot. Artie has no change today, so he has decided to round all his prices to the nearest dollar. If Artie sells 12 pots of marigolds, 9 pots of petunias and 17 pots of begonias, how much will he make?\nNow please strictly answer this question in the json format: \"{\"reasons\": \"(a string of your reasoning process)\", \"answer\": \"(a pure numeric value without unit)\"}\"\n"
