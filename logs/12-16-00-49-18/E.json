The first glass costs $5.\n2. The second glass costs 60% of $5, which is $5 * 0.6 = $3.\n3. The third glass costs $5.\n4. The fourth glass costs 60% of $5, which is $5 * 0.6 = $3.\n5.

The price of the second glass is 60% of $5, which is calculated as (60/100) * $5 = $3.\n2. Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses, so he needs to pay for 16 glasses.\n3. The first glass costs $5, and the second glass costs $3.\n4. From the third glass onwards, the price will repeat the pattern of the first and second glass prices.\n5. So, the total cost of 16 glasses can be calculated as follows:\n   - The cost of the first glass: $5\n   - The cost of the second glass: $3\n   - The cost of the third glass: $5\n   - The cost of the fourth glass: $3\n   - The cost of the fifth glass: $5\n   - The cost of the sixth glass: $3\n   - ...\n   - The cost of the sixteenth glass: $3\n6. We can see that the pattern repeats every two glasses, with the first glass costing $5 and the second glass costing $3.\n7. So, the total cost can be calculated as follows:\n   - The cost of the first two glasses: $5 + $3 = $8\n   - The cost of the next two glasses: $5 + $3 = $8\n   - The cost of the next two glasses: $5 + $3 = $8\n   - ...\n   - The cost of the last two glasses: $5 + $3 = $8\n8. Since there are 16 glasses, we can divide them into groups of two glasses, and there will be 8 groups.\n9. Therefore, the total cost of 16 glasses can be calculated as 8 * $8 = $64.\nAnswer: {\"reasons\": \"The total cost of 16 glasses can be calculated as 8 * $8 = $64.\", \"answer\": \"64\"}"
